CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
-----------

### General

Continuous Integration is a development pratice where developers of a team upload code in a shared repository at least once a Day. An automated build verifies each check-in. This allows a team to find bugs/errors way faster. 

### Benefits

Because of the many Uploads, errors can be discoverd quicker. There is significantly less back-tracking to discover things that went wrong.  If you dont do continuous integration you will have longer Periods between them and automatically more code to check for Errors! 

* Say goodbye to long and tense integrations
* Increase visibility which enables greater communication
* Catch issues fast and nip them in the bud
* Spend less time debugging and more time adding features
* Proceed in the confidence you’re building on a solid foundation
* Stop waiting to find out if your code’s going to work
* Reduce integration problems allowing you to deliver software more rapidly

### Drawbacks

* Much more Responsibilities
